# Working in Team

Working in a team helps you in numerous ways, But at the same time, It has many caveeats also, So first look at what all help will you get while working in a team.

- **More input will be there, Everone in the team has different approaches, So you will get creative ideas**
- **Teaches conflict resolution skills**
- **Promotes a wider sense of Ownership**
- **Increase the interpersonal skills**
- Some team member are extremily good at some area
- Project work should be distrubted based on their interest an sensibility
One caveat of working in a team that i felt was of major concern:
* **Unequal involvment and Participation of different members**
>"This might delay and drastically affect other component of the website"
# Starting with the project

- Frist we have gone throught the design layout given in the form of Figma.
- We have understand the entire flow of given layout with help of UI/UX Designer.
- We have divided the entire layout into smaller components.
- Based on individual team members, Tasks are divided among them.
